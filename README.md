This is all the important work from my Master's thesis, summarised into just a few little files

The main body of work is in "Thesis_work.ipynb", that's where most of the fits for the thesis were generated, model fitting, permutation testing, etc. The other files are mostly just miscellaneous things which might be of some interest one way or another.

Best of luck
