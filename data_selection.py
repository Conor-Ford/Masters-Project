"""
This file was developed to contain functions for data selection of pS2s and DEs from raw straxen peaks data.

You can use it one of two ways:
1. Be on Midway/wherever, input the run_id, and obtain the peaks data along with the selected pS2s and DEs etc.

2. If you already have the peaks data loaded but not processed/selected, you can pass peaks through and get the selection that way
You will also need the run information however, since some fields are added based on the run start time

    This is the original method of data selection used by Keerthana Umesh in her bachelor's thesis project.
    It uses the straxen mini-analysis of "plots_aft_histogram" to plot an area vs range_50p_area histogram
    with area_fraction_top on the colourbar. From this, Keerthana defined regions in which to select the different
    pS2, 1e, and ne populations.

    """
    Section for selection of pS2s, DEs, and S1s based on peak subtype.

    See the below notes to understand what this subtyping does, and what they mean:
    https://xe1t-wiki.lngs.infn.it/doku.php?id=jlong:peak_subtyping_study
    https://xe1t-wiki.lngs.infn.it/doku.php?id=jlong:peak_subtyping_dictionary

    See this note to understand the need for the relabelling, done in the section below:
    https://xe1t-wiki.lngs.infn.it/doku.php?id=yongyu:relabel_ps2_subtype_plugin

    For the avoidance of confusion however, the subtypes are briefly explained below:

    - 10: isoS1 - S1 without nearby peaks
    - 11: S1 - Regular S1 with a matched pS2
    - 12: loneS1 - Regular S1 without a matched pS2
    - 13: sloneS1 - Regular S1 without a matched pS2, with area < 0.5SE
    - 21: DE - Delayed Extracted few electron peak
    - 22: pS2 - S2 matched with an S1, with area >= 5SE
    - 23: isoDE - S2 without nearby peaks, with area < 5SE - not yet implemented
    - 24: isopS2 - S2 without nearby peaks, with area >= 5SE - not yet implemented
    - 25: lonepS2 - S2 with area >= 5SE, without a matched S1 but not categorized as other large S2s.
    - 261: S1olS2 - S2 with a nearby pS2, with area >= max(0.5*pS2, 5SE). After S1 but before S2
    - 262: S2olS2 - S2 with a nearby pS2, with area >= max(0.5*pS2, 5SE). After S2
    - 271: S1PH - Photoionization S2s, with area < max(0.5*pS2, 5SE), after S1 but before S2
    - 272: S2PH - Photoionization S2s, with area < max(0.5*pS2, 5SE), after S2
    - 273: slS1PH - Photoionization S2s after a sloneS1
    - 28: fakeS2 - S2 with area < 5SE, with a paired pS2 satisfying S1-S2 time correlation
    - 29: fakeS2 olS2 - olS2 after the fakeS2 and before the associated pS2
    - 20: fakeS2 PH - Photoionization after the fakeS2 and before the associated pS2

    From this we can see that pS2s are either the subtypes selected below, basically either a normal pS2, 
    a pS2 without a matched S1, or a pS2 that is relatively large, but close to a bigger pS2 (likely a double scatter).

    DEs actually fall under a fair amount of categories, but since many are forms of photoionisation 
    (defined within the study as having occurred within a few drift times of an S1 or large S2), 
    we can just save some effort in the prompt electron cut by not selecting them here.

    I believe some true pS2s are lost in this selection, as 271 and 272 can contain some very large signals by area.
    Could come back to this later and keep only 271s and 272s above a certain area threshold, for example.

    Just a couple of miscellaneous quality cuts on both pS2s and DEs.

    First:
    Couple of things we want to remove from the DEs, mostly unphysical ones. Not many, but still important

    See this note for some justification:
    https://xe1t-wiki.lngs.infn.it/doku.php?id=jlong:sr0_update_se_selection_and_result

    We're not interested in everything in this note, for example because it tries to remove pile-ups, 
    events in which we may also be interested, and therefore want to keep.
    It also imposes a variety of area, width, and time window restrictions on the initial selection,
    and since our model does not care about ne- signals or pS2 windows, we're not interested in these selection cuts either

    Steps are:
    1. Remove any DEs where the maximum contributing PMT is a bottom one - characteristic of dark count pile-ups
    2. Remove any DEs where the area fraction top is > 0.99, or < max_pmt area / total area + 0.01 - bad waveforms

    All total this removes a fair percentage of DEs from the selection, I believe 
    (although these numbers are pre a fiducial volume cut, so certainly less here)
